     * Verse/AI/Toils_Haul.cs: Toil PlaceHauledThingInCell(...)   
     * 
     * We want to add a wait while the pawn puts things into Deep Storage,
     *   so we patch the PlaceHauledThingInCell toil to add the wait.
     * 
     * The way the jobdriver and toils for hauling are set up, when
     * PlaceHauledThingInCell(...) is called to create the Toil, we
     * can't actually tell if the Thing is being carried to Deep Storage.
     * Annoying.  So we create a PreInitAction for the Toil that checks!
     * 
     * If we aren't going into DeepStorage, the initAction happens
     *   instantly, no ticks happen in waiting, and the entire
     *   placement happens at once.
     *
     * We always take the old initAction - which does the actual
     *   placing and set it to happen on ticksRemaining==1
     *   We do this regardless of the test in PreInitAction.
     *   Why?  Saved games.  PreInitAction doesn't get called if
     *   we are already in the middle of the toil when the game
     *   was saved.  But the ticks still happen, so we need
     *   an end condition.    
     * 
     * If the PreInitAction sees it IS going to DeepStorage, 
     *   it sets up the waiting.
     *  -remove the original initAction (still going to happen on tick 1)
     *  -add progress bar (doesn't happen on load, btw)
     *   (could change if it's ever important)
     *  -counts ticks, etc.
     *     
     * Also done, setting up fail conditions.    
     *   (still some TODO)
     * 
     * NOTE: Better approach would be to patch the toil creation
     *       in the JobDriver_HaulToCell, but that would involve
     *       Transpiler editing of an IEnumerable jump table.
     * 
     *       Not this week.
